- 👋 Hi, I’m @IanVicta
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project I’m currently working on, and I’d greatly appreciate any help!  
I’m eager to learn, re-learn, and un-learn throughout this journey.  
The project is called **Fanisi Financial Management System**. Feel free to share suggestions for improvements, potential enhancements, or point out areas where I might have gone wrong. Your feedback will be invaluable to me as I strive to make this project better!
